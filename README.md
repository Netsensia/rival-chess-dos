===============

The original Rival Chess for MS-DOS C++ Source Code.

This was written between 1992 and 1994 as a way to teach myself C by converting an old Pascal chess program I had written a few years earlier.

Thoses were the days when you had to write your own mouse handling routines and draw your own mouse pointers on the screen.  What fun.

It then evolved into a C++ project.

It has a mouse-driven DOS GUI.  The graphics were created by Russell Newman.
