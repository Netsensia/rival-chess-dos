===============

The original Rival Chess for MS-DOS C++ Source Code.

This was written between 1992 and 1994 as a way to teach myself C by converted an old Pascal chess program I had written a few years earlier.

It then evolved into a C++ project.

It has a mouse-driven DOS GUI.  The graphics were created by Russell Newman.
